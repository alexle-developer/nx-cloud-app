          The primary purpose of the Nx-Cloud-App application is to demonstrate the power of leveraging <strong>Nx
            Monorepo</strong> with Angular <strong>NgRx</strong> state management. Therefore, we are focusing on
          something other than building components and structures for the Nx-Cloud-App.
        </p>
        <p>
          To demonstrate NgRx, our sample application must be complex enough to have state management requirements but
          simple enough to implement those requirements within a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, we start with a
          simple Angular reactive form <strong>"Products"</strong> application that does not use NgRx.
        </p>
        <p>Our intention is to replace the state management and component interactions with NgRx for <strong>Products
            NgRx</strong>.</p>
